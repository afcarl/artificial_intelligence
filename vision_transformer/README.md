**coding vision transformer from scratch for image recognition**  
`vision_transformer.ipynb`: implementation of vision transformer from scratch.  
original vision transformer [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)  
according to the paper, the full potential of the vision transformer can only be exploited when it is pretrained on a large dataset. 
In `cifar_10_dataset` and `covid19_and_pneumonia_detection` directories, a pretrained ViT is used for some basic image recogition tasks.
